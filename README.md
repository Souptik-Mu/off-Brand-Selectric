# Overview
It's basically hardware that allows connection between a keybord(usb or ps2) and a parallel port of a dot matrix printer.
This set up lets you type on a pice of paper with a help of a dot matrix printer.

### How I set it up?
Connect the designated pins to arduino and upload the code. (typ.ino)

typ.ino is the file i tested. but the other file i decided to write idk why. (i created this projecct 3 or 4 years ago so i dont remember)

### * It is not complete now the code is missing some lines. Anyone wants to contribute here, welcome..
